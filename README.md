# A prototype for a Text Based Adventure

Demo here: https://admiralpotato.github.io/text_based_adventure_prototype/

## Notes

These are just some meeting notes for some story we'd like to tell

- Yeet the Yote (Coyote),
- Yeet the yena (hyena)
	- Why? Because he's sad?
	- Needs bus pass?
- Bad carpet room
	- Couch with Questionable Stains on it.
	- `use caution` to avoid tripping when walking on the bad carpet.
- Sophisticated security equipment that would have kept you out if it wasn't open and unlocked.
- pile of broken 3D printers
	- Pretty sure one of them works, but I forget which one.
- Path that leads through a dark tunnel to a clearing with a pile of detritus and human waste, and a sketchy looking door.
	- Need RFID badge access to get through door.
- A Duzzy in every room.
